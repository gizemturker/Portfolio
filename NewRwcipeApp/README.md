# MealSuggestion

MealSuggestion is an application that provides meal ideas based on the ingredients entered by the user. The app is one of my side projects, and I am considering migrating it to SwiftUI. The project is built using Swift and UIKit, with the implementation of the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture.

## Description

MealSuggestion is designed to offer users meal suggestions based on the ingredients they input into the app. The application aims to provide users with creative meal ideas using the ingredients they have on hand. I am currently exploring the possibility of migrating the project to SwiftUI for enhanced performance and a more modern user interface.

## Features

- Meal suggestion functionality based on user-input ingredients.
- Implementation of the MVVM architecture for effective data management and presentation.
- User-friendly interface designed for an intuitive and seamless user experience.

## Requirements

- Xcode 12 or later is required for building and running the project.
- The project is developed using Swift and UIKit and is compatible with iOS 14 or later for deployment on physical devices or simulators.

## Installation

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Build and run the project on a simulator or a physical iOS device.
